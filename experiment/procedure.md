**Step-3:** After placing the components on the test bench, connect the wires accordingly.  
**Step-4:** If your connections are correct then you may continue to take down the readings, if not then click on "Reset Button" and try it again.  
**Step-5:** Move the "Beam Voltage" knob and set it to 250 or above to record your readings.  
**Step-6:** Toggle the switch button and move the "Reflector Voltage" knob to set the reflector voltage to maximum negative value.  
**Step-7:** As soon as you start varying the reflector voltage you will observe a voltage value on millivoltmeter.  
**Step-8:** Keep varying the "Reflector voltage" till you get maximum voltage at millivoltmeter (You will get maximum voltage value at values between 180 and 185 of voltage).  
**Step-9:** Note down the value for Output Voltage from millivoltmeter  
**Step-10:** Click on "Add to table" button to record the readings for Output Voltage, Beam Voltage and Reflector Voltage.  
**Step-11:** Click on "E-Plane" button to check its basic properties.
